# Getting Started with Firebase with Flutter

Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for Mobile, Web and Desktop from a single codebase.

## Installation

### Flutter SDK

#### macOS install

To install and run Flutter, your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:

- Operating Systems: macOS (64-bit)
- Disk Space: 2.8 GB (does not include disk space for IDE/tools).
- Tools: Flutter uses git for installation and upgrade. We recommend installing Xcode, which includes git, but you can also install git separately.
  
Downloading straight from GitHub instead of using an archive

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
```
