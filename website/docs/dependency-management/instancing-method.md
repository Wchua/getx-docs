The methods and it's configurable parameters are:

### Get.put()

The most common way of inserting a dependency. Good for the controllers of your views for example.

```js
Get.put<SomeClass>(SomeClass());
Get.put<LoginController>(LoginController(), permanent: true);
Get.put<ListItemController>(ListItemController, tag: "some unique string");
```

This is all options you can set when using put:
```js
Get.put<S>(
  // mandatory: the class that you want to get to save, like a controller or anything
  // note: "S" means that it can be a class of any type
  S dependency

  // optional: this is for when you want multiple classess that are of the same type
  // since you normally get a class by using Get.find<Controller>(),
  // you need to use tag to tell which instance you need
  // must be unique string
  String tag,

  // optional: by default, get will dispose instances after they are not used anymore (example,
  // the controller of a view that is closed), but you might need that the instance
  // to be kept there throughout the entire app, like an instance of sharedPreferences or something
  // so you use this
  // defaults to false
  bool permanent = false,

  // optional: allows you after using an abstract class in a test, replace it with another one and follow the test.
  // defaults to false
  bool overrideAbstract = false,

  // optional: allows you to create the dependency using function instead of the dependency itself.
  // this one is not commonly used
  InstanceBuilderCallback<S> builder,
)
```

### Get.lazyPut
It is possible to lazyLoad a dependency so that it will be instantiated only when is used. Very useful for computational expensive classes or if you want to instantiate several classes in just one place (like in a Bindings class) and you know you will not gonna use that class at that time.

```js
/// ApiMock will only be called when someone uses Get.find<ApiMock> for the first time
Get.lazyPut<ApiMock>(() => ApiMock());

Get.lazyPut<FirebaseAuth>(
  () {
    // ... some logic if needed
    return FirebaseAuth();
  },
  tag: Math.random().toString(),
  fenix: true
)

Get.lazyPut<Controller>( () => Controller() )
```

This is all options you can set when using lazyPut:
```js
Get.lazyPut<S>(
  // mandatory: a method that will be executed when your class is called for the first time
  InstanceBuilderCallback builder,
  
  // optional: same as Get.put(), it is used for when you want multiple different instance of a same class
  // must be unique
  String tag,

  // optional: It is similar to "permanent", the difference is that the instance is discarded when
  // is not being used, but when it's use is needed again, Get will recreate the instance
  // just the same as "SmartManagement.keepFactory" in the bindings api
  // defaults to false
  bool fenix = false
  
)
```

### Get.putAsync
If you want to register an asynchronous instance, you can use `Get.putAsync`:

```js
Get.putAsync<SharedPreferences>(() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.setInt('counter', 12345);
  return prefs;
});

Get.putAsync<YourAsyncClass>( () async => await YourAsyncClass() )
```

This is all options you can set when using putAsync:
```js
Get.putAsync<S>(

  // mandatory: an async method that will be executed to instantiate your class
  AsyncInstanceBuilderCallback<S> builder,

  // optional: same as Get.put(), it is used for when you want multiple different instance of a same class
  // must be unique
  String tag,

  // optional: same as in Get.put(), used when you need to maintain that instance alive in the entire app
  // defaults to false
  bool permanent = false
)
```

### Get.create

This one is tricky. A detailed explanation of what this is and the differences between the other one can be found on [Differences between methods:](#differences-between-methods) section

```js
Get.Create<SomeClass>(() => SomeClass());
Get.Create<LoginController>(() => LoginController());
```

This is all options you can set when using create:

```js
Get.create<S>(
  // required: a function that returns a class that will be "fabricated" every
  // time `Get.find()` is called
  // Example: Get.create<YourClass>(() => YourClass())
  FcBuilderFunc<S> builder,

  // optional: just like Get.put(), but it is used when you need multiple instances
  // of a of a same class
  // Useful in case you have a list that each item need it's own controller
  // needs to be a unique string. Just change from tag to name
  String name,

  // optional: just like int`Get.put()`, it is for when you need to keep the
  // instance alive thoughout the entire app. The difference is in Get.create
  // permanent is true by default
  bool permanent = true
```
